                    <div id="main_container">
                    <p>Although AI image generation provide immense creative potential, there are still some ethical problem need to be addressed:
                    </p>

                        <p> Be aware of the potential misuse of AI-generated images for creating deepfakes, which can be used to defame individuals and create non-consensual explicit content.</p>
                   
                        <li id="bold"> Copyright and Ownership</li>
                        <p>As AI models are trained on vast datasets and often sourced from copyrighted material, there are concerns about whether the generated images infringe on the original creators' rights. Also, it is unclear that who owns the rights to the output such as the creater or the user.</p>
                       
                        <li id="bold"> Consent and Privacy</li> 
                        <p>Ensure that any data used to train AI models, including personal images are obtained with proper consent. Meanwhile, respect individuals' privacy by avoiding using identifiable personal images without explicit permission.</p>
                        <li id="bold"> Respect intellectual property rights</li> 
                        <P> Be transparent about the sources of the training data and ensure that the generated images do not infringe on existing copyrights.</P>

                    <h3>Future prospects of AI image generation</h3>
                    <main>
                        <section class="intro">

                         <p>The future prospects of AI image generation are extensive and promising, with potential applications across a wide range of industries and sectors. Here are some key areas where AI image generation is expected to have a significant impact:
                    </p>

                     <ol>
                        <li>Art and Fashion</li>
                        <li>Product Visualization</li>
                        <li>Healthcare</li>
                        <li>Building Design</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Art and Fashion</h3> 
                            <p>AI can assist artists and designers to save the time and cost as the automating repetitive tasks such as cropping, resizing and filtering are completed by AI (George, n.d.). Also, AI can generate new clothing designs and patterns, which can help fashion designers explore innovative ideas and trends more efficiently. </p>

                        <h3>  Product Visualization </h3>
                            <p> AI technology can generate photorealistic images of products without relying on physical prototypes or traditional photoshoots. By creating realistic product visuals and implementing virtual try-on experiences, AI assists consumers in visualizing products more effectively before making a purchase.

                        <h3>Healthcare</h3> 
                            <p>Ai can generate and enhance medical images, aiding diagnosis and treatment planning. It can simulate medical conditions for training and research purposes. For instance, AI-enabled medical imaging can more accurately forecast the survival rate of patients with tumors by evaluating their grade and stage (ONIX, n.d.). Also, AI-generated photos can be used to create educational materials that help patients understand medical conditions and treatments .</p>

                        <h3>Building Design</h3>
                            <p>AI technology can process extensive collections of existing designs, cultural artifacts, and natural forms to generate original and surprising design concepts (Eloy, 2024). This capability offers architects innovative ideas that they might not have thought of on their own. Hence, incorporating generative AI into the architectural design process allows architects to enhance their efficiency in crafting innovative environments.</p>
