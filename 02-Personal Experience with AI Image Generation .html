                    <h2>Using Copilot as the AI image generator</h2>
                    <p>I used Copilot as one of the AI image generating tools. It is very strong oon generating images. I was quite 
                        impressed with its capability. 
                        I ask Copilot to generate an image which shows family element. It gave me a sweet family image, which sticks to my   
                        request.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Some Challenges I Faced </h2>
                    <p>When I tried to generate an image with very specific and niche details,
                         such as a family wearing traditional clothing from a particular culture while holding specific items, 
                         the results were not as accurate. </p>
                    <img src="Copilot gen family2.jpg">
                    <p>As I asked the AI to generate a family image with 4 members only, but it generate 5 members in the 
                        second photo. 
                        Beside, I asked the AI to generate a family image in 4 members with one sister, one brother and thier parents. 
                        However, it gave out a 5 members family with 3 sibilings and their parents, which is not following my instructions.

                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Quality and Realism: At this moment the generation of image is still very green. 
                                Images are not as realistic as painter. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Complexity and Specificity: When I gave highly detailed or niche prompts, 
                                AI can struggle to accurately interpret and execute the request. 
                                This can result in images that don't fully meet the user's expectation. 
                            </li>
                        </ol>
