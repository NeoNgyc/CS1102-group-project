                    <h2>History LLMs</h2>
                    <p>In the 1960s, according to David (2023), the worldâ€™s first chatbot Eliza was created by Joseph
                        Weizenbaum, which gave
                        the foundation and guidance of natural language processing for the future production of more
                        complex LLMs. Then in 1997,
                        Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks came into existence. When LLMs first emerged, they were
                        created using RNN models
                        with LSTMs and GRUs.</p>

                    <h2> Major technological breakthroughs</h2>
                    <p>Transformers' scalability has led to breakthroughs in language models. LLMs contain upwards of
                        100B parameters.Apart
                        from the scaling, LLMs can generate the text quickly and the use of LLMs were seen to be
                        enabling human creativity and
                        productivity in language and art like never before. (David, 2023)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides, LLMs were improved by
                        using different DNN
                        models.Because of this , we got the pre-trained GPT with 12 transformer blocks.In GPT2, it
                        included four pre- trained
                        GPT model and the largest one contain a d(model) value of 1600 , 48 blocks and 1.5 billion model
                        parameters. It also
                        contained a vocabulary size of 8,000 tokens.(Raiaan,2024)

                    <h2>broad application areas of LLMs</h2>
                    <p>
                        LLMs are widely used in human life, the most common applications are in education, industry, and
                        some training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According
                        to Moore et al.(2022) ,LLMs that make use of produced Natural language processing (NLP) has
                        significantly advanced
                        thanks to pre-trained transformers (GPT), which have also sparked the creation of numerous
                        language-based applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, the City University of Hong Kong provided chatgpt-4 to students to give instant
                        feedback on the educational
                        content and some companies use the robot in LLMs to automatically reply the repeated and simple
                        messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As LLMs have
                        excellent problem-solving skills, contextual awareness, advanced language comprehension, and
                        human-like text production
                        capabilities, it is popular in many areas.
